<h2>FAQ</h2><br>
<h4>STUDENTS</h4><br>

<p><strong>Who can take a Learning Circle course?</strong></p>
<p>Pretty much anyone! Courses may have a minimum and/or maximum age, but as long as you fall within the age range, you are welcome to apply to a Learning Circle course. If you fall outside the age range for a particular course, <a href="/page/contact">get in touch with us</a> to see if there is anything else you might be able to do. For example, if the maximum age for a course is 20, and you are older than this, then you can probably apply to be a mentor for this course, facilitating the students’ learning. You can also view many of our past video lectures on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgUgK231RnrN_W8Zn3P6YsA">YouTube channel</a>, and you can view students’ work and projects on our website.</p>

<p><strong>Does it matter where I live?</strong></p>
<p>Usually no. Some courses are region or country-specific, but many are open to students across the globe. We usually arrange courses according to regional time-zones: Asia-Pacific (APAC); Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and the Americas and the Caribbean (AMCAM).</p>

<p><strong>I’m worried that my English isn’t good enough. Will this be a problem?</strong></p>
<p>Not at all. There will be participants who are native-English speakers and participants who are native-speakers of languages from all over the world. If you are not so confident it will be a great opportunity for you to practise your English in real-world situations, not just describing your favourite colours and your family to your teacher! You will be able to chat to your peers face to face during our weekly group sessions, and also complete written assignments with feedback from your peers. There is no need to be nervous, if you can comfortably understand this FAQ you should be all right in our class.</p>

<p><strong>How will I be assessed?</strong></p>
<p>Don’t worry, you won’t have to sit any exams. In Learning Circle courses we will not give you any multiple choice questions! We want to challenge you and help you grow as thinkers and problem-solvers for the world. We’ll do this through our unique program, which is based primarily on encouraging active participation and completion of class assignments. To graduate from most courses, we require you to attend and complete around ⅗ of classes and assignments, as well as the final project which will usually involve you implementing a project in your local community. Check each course’s page for more information on exactly what you need to do to graduate.</p>

<p><strong>How do I apply/sign up?</strong></p>
<p>Go to our <a href="page/courses">course page</a> and find the course you’d like to take, then hit the “Apply” button!</p>

<p><strong>When will I find out if my application has been successful?</strong></p>
<p>We aim to allow most applicants to take part in the course. The application form is more of a means for us to ensure students are motivated and also to help us know what students are like. This helps us shape the curriculum more around what you would like to learn. We aim to let you know within 2-3 working days and will send you an email confirming your acceptance.</p>

<p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p>
<p>The cost for courses varies. Most of our courses charge a small fee, and some are free. Check out the <a href="page/courses">course page</a> to see details for individual courses.</p>

<p><strong>Where does my money go?</strong></p>
<p>We spend the proceeds from courses to cover the basic costs for running the course, including marketing and software development, partial and full scholarships and sometimes prize funds for Learning Circle users to apply for to help them launch a project. Some money might be given to course partners, depending on the aims of the course. At the moment we reinvest all our proceeds into helping our organization grow, but we foresee that in the future we will also invest and donate a portion of our profits to support organisations that work to further the goals that are at the core of our corporate culture as a social enterprise, of using education to make a more peaceful and sustainable future.</p>

<p><strong>I’m not sure I can afford the course fee, can I still participate?</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to attend this course, but you are unable to pay the fee, please do apply anyway and let us know that you would like to apply for partial or full financial aid. Once you have finished applying to a course and you are accepted, you will be sent an email about how to pay for the course. This email will also include information about financial aid. We are committed to providing equal access to our courses by offering at least 10% of places in each course with full or partial scholarships to all eligible candidates.</p>

<h4>MENTORS (AND COACHES)</h4><br>

<p><strong>Who can sign up to be a mentor for Online LC?</strong></p>
<p>Any person with an interest in a particular course’s field is welcome to apply to be a mentor. If you have graduated from a previous Learning Circle course you are also eligible to apply to be a mentor.</p>

<p><strong>What exactly does being a mentor entail?</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of ways you can help as a mentor for Learning Circle. You can:
    (1) Help us build the curriculum of a particular course. While some course providers create their own curriculum, many of our courses are also community-organized, meaning that any help in suggesting readings and videos for students is much appreciated. This is done prior to the start of the course.
    (2) Volunteer as an expert lecturer (or help us find one) for a topic. This involves giving a 20-30 minute presentation followed by 30-40 mins of questions from and discussion with students.
    (3) Facilitate a weekly group session, which is held the day after the video lecture. This lasts for an hour. Your role is more of a chair, steering the discussion in the right direction and announcing the week’s assignment. Most of our short courses are around five weeks long.
    (4) If group sessions are self-organized, you can be on-call as an expert ‘coach’ in a relevant field, for example, you could answer questions on social media engagement, if that were your area of expertise.
    (5) A combination of any of the above.</p>

<p><strong>What is the time commitment for me as a mentor?</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your role and how much you want to be involved this can be anything upwards of one hour a week. We are very flexible and try to do as much as we can for mentors to be able to fit their volunteering around their busy schedules.</p>

<p><strong>How do I apply to be a mentor or a coach?</strong></p>
<p>Find the particular <a href="page/courses">course</a> you would like to be a mentor for, and click on “Sign up to be a mentor”. If you would like find out more about getting involved on a more general level with Learning Circle, feel free to <a href="/page/contact">contact us</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Does it cost anything?</strong></p>
<p>No. You are already contributing a huge amount to the students’ experience and we thank you for that!</p>

<p><strong>What do I get in return?</strong></p>
<p>A chance to meet, work with and challenge an enthusiastic and idealistic group of students from around the world. A chance to be involved with groundbreaking developments in online education. Mentors come from many different fields and are a great team to work with.</p>

<h4>HOW THE COURSE WORKS</h4><br>

<p><strong>How does a week of Learning Circle classes work?</strong></p>
<p>There are three main elements that make Learning Circle courses different. Every week we look at a different topic, but the rhythm of the class stays the same. A typical week will look like this: on Sunday before the week starts you receive an email with a detailed class schedule and your assignments (this may require some reading, watching, research, writing, creativity and critical thinking). On Wednesday, around 6pm in your time zone, we organize a live Hangout on Air with an expert, where you have a chance to ask all of your questions. If you won’t be able to watch live, you can submit questions in advance and watch the lecture later in the evening. On Thursday, also around 6pm in your time zone you have the opportunity to speak face-to-face with your classmates in a smaller group (with 5-10 students, depending on numbers). Depending on the course, you may also be given additional assignments, which will give you a chance to meet in person students from a different region. The days on which lectures and group sessions are held may differ from course to course.</p>

<p><strong>What makes Online LC courses different?</strong></p>
<p>We believe in student-led education. This means that you are responsible for your own learning. You will be asked to lead group discussions and in most courses you will create your own community projects. We provide you with suggestions about things that we find interesting as part of our curriculum. However, you are always encouraged to find your own reading resources and guide your own direction of research. We assign homework prompts, but we give you freedom over how to complete them. As previous homeworks we have received infographics, videos, and yes, also songs and poems. Also, we’re not a typical online class, because you will actually be meeting to people and talking to them in live hangouts. It’s a really fun and social way to learn!</p>

<p><strong>What is the time commitment?</strong></p>
<p>The time commitment for you as a student of most Learning Circle courses is around 4-6 hours a week. There is a 1 hour video lecture each week and 1-2 hours of group discussion and assignment time. On top of this you have pre-class readings and many students choose to spend more time working on assignments with their fellow students.</p>


<p><strong>I read that you might be using some of my data for research for a PhD. What does this mean?</strong></p>
<p>Hanna, the founder of Learning Circle, is doing a computer science PhD looking at online learning. She is doing her PhD at the Open Lab at Newcastle University, UK, which pioneers research in human-computer interaction. As with most classes, we will take attendance registers to help us improve the course and know whether you have attended enough to be able to graduate. Hanna will also use these statistics along with information from your course application forms and feedback you provide (e.g. when we send you feedback forms) to look at how educators can improve online learning. Your data will mostly be in the form of a number (e.g. “33 students attended this lecture”) and we wouldn’t use your name without your permission (e.g. instead of “Jane Smith said that…” we would say “Student A said that…”). It is really important that Hanna has a large sample to draw her research from, but you can opt-out if you wish to. You can see how to do that and more about how we use and store your data in our <a href="/page/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h4>TECHNOLOGY</h4><br>

<p><strong>What technology will I need?</strong></p>
<p>You will need a computer with access to the internet, a webcam, microphone and headphones. To access the video lectures and discussions you should have a high-speed internet connection. See our Setting Up page for more information and how to test your internet connection..</p>

<p><strong>Do I need to download any software?</strong></p>
<p>Not really. All the software we use is free and available on the internet. You will need a free Google account. You can do this by signing up for an @gmail.com email account or you can keep your email address (e.g. with @live.com, @outlook.com or @yahoo.com) and link it to your Google account, <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup">here</a>. You will also need a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> account since lots of our discussion will take place on Facebook, or on the Learning Circle platform. The one thing you possibly need to download, if you don’t have it already, is Google’s free Hangouts browser extension/plug-in, which allows you to run Google Hangouts. This is the video programme, similar to Skype, which we use to hold the video lectures and group discussions. Click on <a href="https://www.google.com/hangouts/">this link</a> to download the Google Hangouts browser extension/plug-in.</p>

<p><strong>I don’t have my own computer. Is that ok?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that’s fine. As long as you have access to a computer with a relatively good internet connection, webcam, microphone and headphones then you should have no problems taking part in the course.</p>

<h4>LEGAL</h4><br>

<p><strong>Do you have a privacy policy?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it is available to read <a href="/page/privacy">here</a>. You should also familiarize yourself with our <a href="/page/terms">terms of use</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Are you licensed by all your course providers?</strong></p>
<p>We work with a number of different course providers to run courses on a variety of courses, for example alumni of LC schools run the Online LC courses. If a course has the branding of a particular organization, then this means that we are affiliated or partnered with them and that the course is in adherence with their standards.</p>
